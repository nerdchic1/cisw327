  <h1>Introduction</h1>
   </div>
    <p>My name is Maly Xiong. I currently reside in Stockton, California.
      I am 30 years old. I just got married last September. Carl and I have
	  been dating for almost 10 years. I'm excited and looking 
	  forward to the next chapter of my life and seeing what comes next.
    </p>

  <h1>Education & Career Goals</h1>
 </div>
    <p>I am a returning student. The last college I attended was San 
      Joaquin Delta College. After going to school there for a few years,
      life happens, and in return a loss of motivation; so I dropped out. 
	  I attempted to go back again after a couple years passed and still was 
 	  unsure on what I should major in. Thus I ended up leaving again. This 
	  time around, I've rededicated myself to my studies in achieving my 
	  educational goals and I couldn't be more excited and ready to pursue 
	  a career of my choosing. 
    <br><br>
      I'm majoring in Computer Science and I plan to obtain my AA and 
      transfer to a CSU or UC San Diego for my Bachelors. My GPA has suffered
	  from the last time I was in school so I have a lot of work ahead of me. 
      However, I believe that with dedication, discipline and hard work, anything 
	  is achievable. 
	<br><br>  
	  My career goals are to be a Software Developer. I would like 
	  to help develop systems software for big companies. I want to work on 
	  developing software that will be used in the long run. I would also like to 
	  develop software that will make a big impact on solving big problems.
    <br><br>
      Other professions I'm also considering in the industry are Information 
	  Systems Management, Cybersecurity, and database analysis.
